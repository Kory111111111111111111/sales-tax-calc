# Google Sheets Integration Debug Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Fallback Data Removed

The fallback device data has been completely removed. The app will now ONLY work with Google Sheets data. This will help us debug exactly what's happening.

## 🔧 Making Your Google Sheet Publicly Accessible

Your Google Sheet must be publicly accessible for the CSV export to work. Follow these steps:

1. **Open your Google Sheet**: 
   - Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oN_d2juKl41aYapyN7c3HskEdVswgusn/edit?gid=1807771359#gid=1807771359

2. **Change Sharing Settings**:
   - Click the "Share" button (top right)
   - Click "Change to anyone with the link"
   - Set permission to "Viewer" 
   - Click "Done"

3. **Test the CSV Export URL**:
   - Open this URL in your browser: 
   - `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oN_d2juKl41aYapyN7c3HskEdVswgusn/export?format=csv&gid=1807771359`
   - You should see CSV data download or display

## 🐛 Debugging Process

The app now has comprehensive debugging. Check your browser console for:

1. **🔄 Fetching device data from Google Sheets...**
2. **📍 URL: [the sheets URL]**
3. **📡 Response status: [HTTP status]**
4. **📄 CSV length: [number of characters]**
5. **🔍 Column detection results**
6. **📱 Sample devices loaded**

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: HTTP 403 (Forbidden)
**Cause**: Sheet is not publicly accessible
**Solution**: Follow sharing steps above

### Issue 2: HTTP 404 (Not Found)  
**Cause**: Wrong sheet ID or gid
**Solution**: Verify the URL matches your actual sheet

### Issue 3: Empty CSV or No Devices Processed
**Cause**: Column structure doesn't match expected format
**Solution**: Check console logs for column detection results

## 📊 Expected CSV Format

The app expects:
- **Column B (index 1)**: Device names (e.g., "iPhone 17")
- **Column E (index 4)**: MSRP prices (e.g., "899.99") 
- **Column I (index 8)**: Prepaid prices (optional)

Alternative headers it will auto-detect:
- Phone: "Phone", "Device", "Product", "Model"
- MSRP: "MSRP", "RIC Purchase Payment", "Price"
- Prepaid: "Suggested Prepaid", "Prepaid"

## ✅ Testing Steps

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Look for the debugging output starting with emoji indicators
6. If you see errors, follow the solutions above

## 📞 If Still Not Working

Share the console output (the lines with emojis) and we can diagnose the exact issue.
